# AccessApp (एक्सेस ऐप)

> **Bridging Accessible Mobility, Spoken Guidance, and Community Confidence**

AccessApp is an accessibility-first Flutter application designed to empower individuals with physical, sensory, and communication needs. Engineered around real-world accessibility infrastructure in Goa, India, AccessApp combines spatial mapping, spoken landmark navigation, offline resilience, digital disability credentials, and emergency tools into a unified, privacy-focused mobile experience.

## The Story Behind AccessApp

Every day, millions of people with disabilities, elderly citizens, and parents with strollers face journeys that look trivial on conventional map apps. A route says *"500 meters — 6 min walk"*.

**What conventional maps don't tell you:**
- Is the footpath broken or blocked by construction?
- Does the clinic entrance have five stairs and no ramp?
- For someone with low vision, which way are you actually facing when you exit a bus?
- When boarding public transit or entering a government office, how do you quickly prove your disability credentials without digging out fragile paper certificates?

For a wheelchair user or a person with visual impairment in cities like Panaji or Margao, a journey doesn't fail because the destination is missing. It fails because of the **invisible barriers** along the way.

We built **AccessApp** to bridge that gap. It is a lightweight, privacy-focused mobile application that turns OpenStreetMap into a living accessibility companion — guiding users with relative turn degrees, spoken landmarks, crowdsourced hazard warnings, and a digital offline Unique Disability ID (UDID) pass.

## Core Features

### 1. Accessible Map & Spatial Discovery
- **Interactive Geospatial Map**: OpenStreetMap rendering powered by `flutter_map` and `latlong2`.
- **Multi-Style Map Layers**: Toggle between Standard OSM, Satellite View, and Public Transport layers.
- **3D Perspective Tilt Mode**: Perspective tilt and rotation for depth perception and street orientation.
- **Live GPS Tracking**: One-tap center-and-follow positioning with real-time accuracy and weak-signal fallbacks.
- **Accessibility Filtering**: Filter places by category (Hospitals, Restaurants, Transit, Pharmacies), high friendliness threshold (8.5+), and travel mode suitability.

### 2. Spoken Audio Navigation & Landmark Guidance
- **Strict Blind-Only Voice Policy**: Spoken cues, auditory turn prompts, and landmark announcements are strictly gated to the **Blind / Low Vision** persona.
- **"Where Am I?" Spatial Orientation**: Spoken announcement providing heading, street location, and nearest verified landmark.
- **Audio Landmark Scanning**: Rapid category exploration for nearby transit, medical facilities, banks, and dining venues.
- **Proximity Hazard Alerts**: Audio warnings when approaching reported obstacles (broken ramps, construction, missing tactile paving).

### 3. Digital Disability Pass & UDID Medical ID
- **Offline Assistance ID Card**: High-contrast digital ID modeled after official credentials for transit conductors and staff.
- **UDID Verification & Details**: Displays UDID number, disability category, percentage, issuing authority, and dates.
- **Smart Document Scanner (OCR)**: On-device optical character recognition via Google ML Kit to extract UDID certificate numbers from physical documents.
- **ICE Medical Card & Emergency QR**: Instant access to blood group, conditions, allergy notes, and emergency medical QR code.

### 4. Smart SOS Safety Beacon
- **Accidental-Tap Protection**: 3-second interactive countdown with cancel button and vibration feedback.
- **Audible Siren Beacon**: High-volume repeating siren loop for immediate personal safety and bystander alerting.
- **Voice Help Broadcast**: Synthesized emergency speech loop announcing identity and distress message.
- **1-Tap ICE Dialer**: Pre-configured emergency contacts (family, doctor, helpline) with direct phone and SMS dispatch.

### 5. Offline Map Package Management
- **Regional Offline Packs**: Download focused offline tile packages:
  - **Panaji City Center & Mandovi** (~45 MB)
  - **North Goa Coastal Belt** (~85 MB)
  - **South Goa Heritage & Margao** (~65 MB)
- **Storage Management**: Progress-tracked downloads, local storage accounting, and one-tap deletion.

### 6. Community Verification & Reviews
- **Feature Confirmation (+3 Points)**: Verify individual accessibility features (step-free ramps, wide doors, braille, elevators).
- **Structured 1-10 Reviews (+5 Points)**: Multi-dimensional ratings across staff, communication, assistance, physical access, and restrooms.
- **Community Points & History**: Earn points toward local access advocate badges with activity tracking.
